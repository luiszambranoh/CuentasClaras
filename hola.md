> Believe me: AI won’t understand all these real world problems, context, deployment issues, economics, and won’t plan this. Sure: they can help you, but you’re the real designer, it’s like to think that an obrero which puts the blocks fast and kind of smart understands all the context just as an architec does.

# 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

I’ll show you my step by step process to create this app from zero to nothing, first i opened up my vscode code and ask chatgpt to write an good ui, copy as paste it… WAIT! do you think devs only write code as beast? no, you first have to plan all of it, without a structure you’re nothing, it’s like asking ambbiguotly some working man to put blocks and espect the building to stay still, without an architech, i don’t think you’ll get any futher.

FIrst of all, we’re not code writers, we are problem solvers, so… which problem am i trying to solve with this product? <Show my notion account and give a little bit of story time>, here in my country: Venezuela, I see so often that small entrepeneurs still use notebooks for they business acounting, which isn’t the more relaiable option, they don’t have a clear accounting of how much they earn or spent for the business, this gets even more important when they have multiples employees… what happens if the notebook gets wet… it’s just not reliable, so i thought: {help me to finish the point}, so that’s the problem and the solution i propose, which tool will I use to solve that? the one i see more reliable is coding, but before choosing the fanciest stack, I looked for almost all people has (even kids): a smartphone, so my solution has to be focused on smartphone. There’s mostly android, but i cannot assume all prople use that platform, so apartlend i should code for both… THanks goodness i woudln’t have to, using react native i could deploy to android, IOS and later for the web with a single codebase.

Once I knew that I can go on with what I think is the more important labor of a software engineer the art of crafting a good system schema: without this crutial step you can build: for sure, but you’re building is more likely to fall all apart, and even if you did without planning, you’re not satisfied what the final outcome was, so you modify the structure making it weak. Hence i designed it: using this tool <dbdiagram.io> i’ve designed the db, then I created all the dataflow diagram i needed with escalidraw and I get that done.

Based on that I’ve chossed my stack: <show my stack in notion>

Finally I’ve gotta plan what my road will be like, as <x person> says: <QUOTE A STOIC QUOTE “ningun viento es favorable para aquel que no tiene rumbo” in spanish>, now that I’ve got all of this, now let’s do the headaching part: coding.
